Dear NEST Community,

In light of the impact of the PolyNetwork hack and to safeguard the interests of all NEST holders and users, we will be conducting a 1:1 airdrop of NEST 2.0 tokens to holders of NEST 1.0 tokens on the BNB chain. The airdrop will take place today at 18:00 UTC+8. As a result, the existing NEST 1.0 tokens on the BNB chain will be deprecated.

However, we would like to remind you that you will be unable to receive NEST 2.0 tokens in the following cases:
1. If your NEST 1.0 token address is associated with the hacker's address.
2. If you have conducted any NEST token transactions on PancakeSwap or UIN platforms after July 7th.
Please ensure that you take note of these conditions to ensure a smooth receipt of NEST 2.0 tokens.

Once the token airdrop is completed, you can add NEST 2.0 tokens to your wallet using either of the following methods:
1. Manually add NEST 2.0 tokens to your wallet with the following details:
- Token Address: 0xcd6926193308d3B371FdD6A6219067E550000000
- Token Symbol: NEST
- Token Decimal: 18
2. Quickly add NEST 2.0 tokens to your wallet by visiting nestfi.org.

After utilizing NEST 2.0 tokens, you can freely access all the functionalities offered by NEST. However, please note that NEST 1.0 tokens will no longer have any functionality. If your NEST 1.0 tokens are still involved in any pending futures orders, they will be automatically converted to NEST 2.0 tokens upon order closure.

We sincerely appreciate your support for the NEST protocol. Should you have any inquiries or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you!

The NEST Team
