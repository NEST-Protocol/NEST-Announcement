## NEST3.5 Development Announcement

### Current progress

The development of the core code has been completed, and has been deployed on the test network. Everyone is welcome to participate in the test.

Github: https://github.com/NEST-Protocol/NEST-Oracle-V3.5

The audit will be carried out at the end of December, and the audit is expected to be completed in 2 weeks.

### Important updates
#### Quote

Update the NEST quotation mechanism. Quotation mining requires simultaneous quotation of two trading pairs and NEST staking. Any quotation will require two denominated assets to quote the price instead of using a single denominated asset. Currently, one with ETH and another with the Quotation Pool Token.


Namely: ETH/USDT, ETH/NEST or ETH/HBTC, ETH/NHBTC...

> Since other tokens have not released enough quotation vouchers (NToken) after opening, two quotations cannot be made at the same time. The single quotation interface is still reserved. When the corresponding quotation certificate (NToken) exceeds 1 million, the interface automatically becomes invalid.

#### Quotation certificate-NToken
##### Open NToken

You can open quotation pairs freely, you need to pay NEST fees, and NEST goes to DAOã€‚
