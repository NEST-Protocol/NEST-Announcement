Dear NEST Community Members,

We believe that many of you are already aware that NEST has been utilizing the cross-chain bridge services provided by PolyNetwork. However, in July of this year, PolyNetwork fell victim to a hacker attack (official statement: [link](https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675591279005106178)). As a result, NEST's assets on PolyNetwork were stolen by hackers, including a significant loss of 134,983,260 NEST ERC20 tokens and 9,850,068,599 NEST BEP20 tokens. Additionally, due to the ongoing sale of the stolen NEST tokens by the hackers, the price of NEST has experienced a continuous decline since July.

Current hacker address: 0x0A6470f19620506942d903AC65E0e8efEDF768B2 [etherscanlink](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0A6470f19620506942d903AC65E0e8efEDF768B2)

In the aftermath of the hacking incident, NESTDAO has taken the following steps:
1. Attempted negotiations with the hackers to reclaim the stolen NEST tokens, but a consensus could not be reached.
2. Attempted to seek compensation from PolyNetwork, which has yet to announce any compensation plans.

Given the significant amount of NEST stolen on the BSC chain, to safeguard the interests of NEST holders on the BSC chain, NESTDAO passed a proposal to replace NEST BEP20 tokens. On July 11th, we successfully completed the replacement of NEST BEP20 tokens (Official Statement: [link](https://twitter.com/NEST_Protocol/status/1678766351295606785), which effectively rendered the value of stolen NEST BEP20 tokens held by the hacker to zero and minimized the losses of the NEST community on the BSC chain.

We call upon the users of our community to:
1. Refrain from engaging in any transactions associated with the hacker address.
2. Avoid purchasing NEST tokens on Ethereum-based DEXs (such as Uniswap, 1inch, and other decentralized exchanges).
We are actively communicating and coordinating with various parties to address this situation.
