# NEST Protocol v3.6 will continue the repurchase model of v3.5 on the basis of the following functionallyï¼š

1. Add a voting governance module which will remove system maintenance accounts by voting after v3.6 launches. Decentralize developer rights to the community and require 51% votes for any changes of the protocol.

2. Completely elimination of dividends with all income used for repurchase.

3. Quotation scale adjustment: NEST Token dual track quotation scale 30 ETH unchanged, nToken quotation scale adjusted to 10 ETH, quotation fee of NEST Token and nToken adjusted from 0.33% of the scale ratio to a fixed value of 0.1 ETH.

4. The quantity of verification block is proposed to be adjusted from 25 to 20.

5. NestNode Token independent mining separates from NEST miner mining and gets NEST Token by block with the 15% speed of all NEST Token mining.

Non-functional adjustments:

1. Adjust the contract structure and redefine the contracts that are allowed to change and need to be fixed this time and in the future.

2. Split DAO into ledger and application (currently there is only one application: repurchase and in the future there may be more DAO applications) which is equivalent to reinventing a Snapshot governed functional contract within NEST Protocol that fully executes on-chain.

3. Adjust the contract data structure mainly to save Gas consumption and part of the calculation will have accuracy loss which is controlled within one part per trillion after the adjustment.

After the official launch of NEST Protocol v 3.6, a series of financial products developed based on NEST Protocol will also be launched one after another during this period. By that time, oracle will serve as the core function of NEST Protocol and the whole protocol will be transformed into an on-chain non-cooperative game system.
