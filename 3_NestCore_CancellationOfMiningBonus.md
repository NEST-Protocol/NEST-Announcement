Based on the current NEST mining situation and user usage, NestCore developers decided to make the following adjustments to the NEST incentive mechanism after repeated demonstrations:

The addition of the two influencing factors of the lending cycle and the lending daily interest rate will be added to the NEST award. Next, new products will be developed to reflect the pricing function of NEST Token. The NEST reward in online mortgage lending products is only used as user fee. Rewards and compensation.

At 3 o'clock this afternoon, the developer implemented the adjustment and the upgrade was successful.
