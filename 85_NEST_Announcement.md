Dear Nest community members,

We would like to inform you about an important incident regarding Ploy Network. Recently, Ploy Network experienced a hacker attack, resulting in the theft of NEST tokens on the Ethereum network and unauthorized token minting on the BSC network. This attack has caused significant distress and losses to us and the entire community.

First and foremost, we would like to sincerely apologize to all affected community members. We highly value the interests and contributions of each member, and this attack has severely infringed upon your rights. We are committed to taking immediate action to resolve this issue and minimize the losses as much as possible.

In response to this incident, we have implemented a series of emergency measures to protect the community's interests. Additionally, we are considering the replacement of the NEST token. Due to the fact that the liquidity provided on platforms such as Uniswap and Pancake Swap is from the hackers, we are unable to verify the authenticity and security of these transactions. Therefore, we have decided not to recognize any transactions on these platforms and will not facilitate the replacement of NEST tokens purchased through them. Furthermore, the addresses involved in transactions on these swap platforms will be blacklisted.

We understand that this decision may cause inconvenience to some community members. However, we believe it is necessary to protect the interests and security of the majority of the community. We will closely monitor the situation and seek better solutions while ensuring the long-term stability and security of the community.

At the same time, we urge all community members to remain calm and rational. Please refrain from blindly trusting any unofficial information to avoid further fraud and losses. We will promptly release further announcements and updates to ensure the community receives timely and accurate information.

During this challenging time, we need unity and support among community members. Please continue to assist each other, share information, and provide any clues that may help resolve the issue. We firmly believe that through collective efforts, we can overcome this difficulty and rebuild a stronger and safer Nest community.

Once again, we sincerely appreciate your understanding and support.

The Nest Team
