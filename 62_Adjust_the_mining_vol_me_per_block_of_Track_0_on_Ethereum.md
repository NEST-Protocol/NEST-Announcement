[Announcement: ]Adjust the mining volume per block of Track 0 on Ethereum 

After the merger of Ethereum, the time to generate one block has changed from the original 14 seconds to the current 12 seconds. In order to stabilize the mining speed of NEST, we are going to adjust the mining volume of NEST per block of Track 0 on Ethereum from 24 NEST per block to 20 NEST per block.
