Dear members of the NEST community,

Moving forward, NEST will focus more on the development and promotion of its Oracle service, and the business operations of NESTFi will be gradually adjusted. As decided by the NEST DAO, the following adjustments will be made:
1. Starting from December 12, 2023, at 3:00 UTC, NESTFi will cease the opening of new positions. Existing positions can be closed, but no additional positions can be added.
2. On January 31, 2024, all remaining positions will be automatically settled.
