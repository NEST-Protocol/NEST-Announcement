## NEST FI Upgrades on 08 June

Dear NEST Community Members,

After extensive discussions and deliberations, NESTDAO is thrilled to announce that the NESTFi contract will be deployed on the scroll Alpha Testnet on June 8, 2023, as part of our efforts to expand the NEST ecosystem and support the development of the scroll ecosystem.

This significant decision opens up new opportunities and potential for our community. By introducing the NESTFi contract to the scroll Alpha Testnet, we will be able to further test and refine the functionality and performance of NESTFi. We strongly believe that this will provide our users with more choices and enhance the overall value of the NEST ecosystem.

To ensure a smooth deployment of the NESTFi contract, we have made thorough preparations and are closely collaborating with the scroll team. We are working together to ensure the contract's seamless operation and are prepared to address any issues that may arise.

We are confident that the deployment of NESTFi will bring new opportunities to the community and further drive the development of the NEST ecosystem. We will continue to monitor the progress of the scroll ecosystem and provide support and assistance to facilitate wider adoption and collaboration opportunities.

We are incredibly excited about achieving this significant milestone and look forward to witnessing the successful operation of the NESTFi
