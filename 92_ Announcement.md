Dear NEST 

We have identified certain users attempting to purchase stolen NEST 1.0 tokens at a low price from hackers via Uniswap, subsequently depositing these tokens into Coinbase addresses in an attempt to launder them and exchange them through our official channels. We strictly prohibit all NEST community users from engaging in such activities, as they effectively assist hackers in money laundering.

To protect the overall interests of the community and ensure the successful completion of the token swap, please take note of the following:

1. Any NEST token purchases associated with hacker addresses, whether conducted on-chain (Uniswap/1inch/Pancake, etc.) or directly from hackers, will result in the loss of your eligibility to exchange for NEST 2.0 tokens.

2. Starting from September 20th, any NEST 1.0 token withdrawals from Coinbase exchange addresses for token swap applications will require you to provide verifiable deposit and transfer records from Coinbase's official sources to prove that your NEST 1.0 token source is not connected to hackers.

Coinbase exchange address 1 (additional addresses may be added in the future): 0xA9D1e08C7793af67e9d92fe308d5697FB81d3E43

We will reject and destroy tokens from hacker addresses within the token swap contract. Please refrain from attempting to purchase NEST 1.0 tokens further.
