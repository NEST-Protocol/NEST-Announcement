Dear NEST Community Members,

We would like to inform all users of the NESTFi that all open positions will be closed on January 31st at 24:00 UTC. Positions will be settled at the market price at the time of closure.

Please note that withdrawal and spot swap functionalities will remain unaffected by this action.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we make this adjustment. For any inquiries or assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team.

Thank you for your continued support of NEST Protocol.

Sincerely,

The NEST Protocol Team
