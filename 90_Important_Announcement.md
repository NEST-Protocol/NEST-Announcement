Dear members of the NEST community,

Greetings to you all! In recent times, the NEST community has faced significant challenges due to the PolyNetwork hack incident. In order to safeguard the interests of all NEST holders, especially to prevent the negative impact of the theft of over 134M NEST ERC20 tokens by hackers, we have undertaken a token replacement initiative.

Since the occurrence of the hack incident in July, the NESTDAO team has been actively engaging with various major exchanges, urging them to suspend the deposit of the old NEST tokens. This measure aims to prevent hackers from depositing stolen NEST tokens on exchanges for selling or money laundering purposes. However, despite our efforts, more than 10M old NEST tokens have still been deposited on the Coinbase exchange. Furthermore, this deposit activity continues, posing risks to achieving our token replacement goals.

To ensure that the interests of NEST community members remain safeguarded, we have temporarily halted the token replacement requests associated with Coinbase addresses. We plan to process these requests collectively after September 5th of this year. During this time, we will conduct thorough verification of accounts and transactions to ensure that the tokens being withdrawn are not stolen by hackers. For all requests related to the replacement of tokens for these associated addresses, we kindly ask for your patience as we proceed.

We deeply regret any inconvenience caused and genuinely appreciate your concerns. The NESTDAO team remains unwavering in its commitment to safeguarding the community's interests. Our actions are thoughtfully considered and we continue to strive for the security and welfare of the community. Your understanding and support mean the world to us.

Thank you!
