[Announcement]Temporarily lending tokens for the deployment of NEST protocol to KCC 

Dear NEST community members, 

We would like to inform you that to participate the KCC Unicorn Contest, NEST (and also the related tokens) will be deployed to KCC on April 15, 2022 (estimated date).

However, since the cross-chain bridge is currently not enabled, several related tokens (see the table below) would be lent for the deployment. The assets would be returned as soon as the cross-chain bridge is enabled.

| Token | Cross-chain Supply | Lending Amount |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| PETH | 1,000,000 | 15 |
| PUSD | 1,000,000,000 | 90,000 |
| PBTC | 10,000 | 1 |
| NEST | 1,000,000,000 | 6,000,000 |



Thank you for your support.


The NEST Team
