# Mining algorithm modification

The mining algorithm is adjusted by the unilateral increase of the previous loan cycle variable or the loan interest rate variable to satisfy the loan period variable greater than or equal to 7 days (cycle >= 7), and the loan interest rate variable is greater than or equal to three ten thousandths (interest >= 0.3â€°), the trigger will be triggered.

## Adjustment reason

> Unilateral Bonus will result in low cost access to NEST

Unilaterally increase the loan interest rate variable, and the number of NEST obtained and the interest paid are not equal.

> Some miners increase the bonus, and the order is frequent

Some miners hope to get more NEST through the addition method, resulting in frequent ticketing.
