## NEST plans to release an open version on BSC as follows:

1. Everyone can open the quotation pair and has partial management authority over the quotation pair;

2. The signatures of interfaces such as post, close and price query are adjusted accordingly, but the core mechanism of nest price formation remains unchanged;

3. The same quotation pair can be opened multiple times and compete with each other;

4. Optimize and adjust some parameters of nest.
