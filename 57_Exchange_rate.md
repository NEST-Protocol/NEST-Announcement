[Announcement] Exchange rate for the merger of the NEST protocol and FORT protocol

After a vote from July 8th to July 14th, 2022, the NEST community approved the NEST and FORT merger plan. According to the voting proposal, besides the investors of FORT in the early stage, the consideration for the merger of NEST and FORT is the ratio of the 7-day average USDT prices of the two tokens. 

This announcement explains the specific calculation method of the 7-day average price as follows:

1) Calculate the daily average price* for each day from July 8th to July 14th, 2022
2) Calculate the arithmetic average of the daily average prices obtained in 1) as the 7-day average price 

*Note: the daily average price is the arithmetic average of all prices for the day. Specifically, all prices for the day for $DCU include the prices corresponding to all transactions that occur in the FORT official DCU swap of the day. All prices for the day for $NEST are all quotation prices for the day from the NEST oracle on BNB chain.


Based on the above method and data from July 8th to July 14th, 2022, the 7-day average prices for $DCU and $NEST are equal to 0.253139024 USDT and 0.032586735 USDT, respectively. Thus the exchange rate for the merger of the NEST protocol and FORT protocol is 1 $DCU = 7.768161615 $NEST
