# Mining efficiency change instructions

On July 09, 2019, due to the total mining volume exceeding 5E, the NEST mining algorithm-total attenuation was attenuated to 0.8153726976 according to the rule of 0.96 per 100 million attenuation.

## Attenuation limit change

> The first 300 blocks are dug out over 20,000 NEST, triggering the following attenuation. (normal)

The first 300 blocks were dug out more than 16,307.453952 NEST, triggering the following attenuation. (total attenuation)

> Single mining limit 40,000 NEST (normal)

Single mining upper limit 32614.907904 NEST. (total attenuation)
