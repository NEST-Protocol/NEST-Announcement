[Announcement] NEST 4.3 upgrade and mining reward adjustment


The latest version NEST 4.3 allows one quotation channel to quote multiple assets at the same time, which significantly saves relevant GAS fees. It is planned to merge mainstream assets into one channel for quotation, and adjust the mining reward on the premise of almost no impact on the quotation density. The detailed adjustments are listed below:  

1. Shutdown NEST 3.6 on the Ethereum main network and upgrade the NEST&ETH pair to NEST 4.3.  
2. Decrease the mining reward of NEST 4.3 to 24 per block, and NN to 4.5 per block. The accumulated mining reward is about 175885 NEST per day.
3. Decrease the mining reward of NEST 4.3 on BSC from 5 to 1 per block. The accumulated mining reward is about 28800 NEST per day.
4. Decrease the mining reward of NEST 4.3 on Polygon from 1 to 0.3 per block. The accumulated mining reward is about 11782 NEST per day.
5. Decrease the mining reward of NEST 4.3 on KCC to 0.1 per block. The accumulated mining reward is about 2880 NEST per day. 
 
After the adjustment, the total mining reward per day is 219347 NEST, while before, it was about 1432781 NEST.  
The adjustment on Ethereum will affect the calls of the Oracle. Please make some necessary adjustments by yourself. If you have any questions, please contact the NEST Team (hello@nestprotocol.org).
