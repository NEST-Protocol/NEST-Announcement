Dear NEST Community,

We would like to share some important news about the evolution of our platform. NEST Protocol will return to our original vision - becoming a leading oracle service provider. As we embrace this renewed focus, our goal is to extend our reach across an even wider array of public blockchains and Layer 2 solutions.

We are actively exploring new business models and application scenarios for our oracle services that can bring additional value to our users and the broader blockchain ecosystem.

This strategic realignment allows us to leverage our expertise and experience in oracles, ensuring that NEST Protocol continues to be synonymous with trustworthiness and reliability in the decentralized world.

As always, we value the support and input of our community. Your feedback is crucial as we navigate this path and strive to achieve our shared vision. Stay connected with us for upcoming updates and developments. Together, we will shape the future of decentralized oracles and empower the blockchain space with innovative solutions.

Thank you for being a part of the NEST community.

Warm regards, 

NEST DAO
