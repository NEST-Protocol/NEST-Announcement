Dear NEST Community Members,

We hereby solemnly announce that NESTFi will officially cease operations on January 31st. All positions still held will be liquidated at the market price as of 24:00 on January 31st. This marks a new stage in our project's development where we will dedicate our efforts to return to our original vision, focusing on the expansion and application of oracle services and the development of NESTCraft.

NEST has always been committed to becoming a leading provider of blockchain oracle services. We believe that concentrating on our core strengths will lead us to greater success. In the expansion of our oracle services, we have already made encouraging progress and will continue to explore and innovate on this path.

This strategic realignment will enable us to better leverage our expertise and experience in the field of oracles, ensuring that NEST Protocol continues to be synonymous with trust and reliability in the decentralized world.

We highly value the support and opinions of our community members. Your feedback is crucial to our development path. We will take every suggestion seriously as we pursue our common vision. Please stay connected with us for upcoming updates and developments. Together, we will forge the future of decentralized oracles and bring innovative solutions to the blockchain space.

Thank you for being a part of the NEST community; let's continue on this journey together.

Sincerely,

The NEST Protocol Team
