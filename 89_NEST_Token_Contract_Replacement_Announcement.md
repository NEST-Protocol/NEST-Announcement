Dear NEST Community Members,

We believe many of you are already aware that NEST has been utilizing the cross-chain bridge service provider, PolyNetwork. Unfortunately, in July of this year, PolyNetwork fell victim to a hacker attack (official statement: [https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675591279005106178](https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675591279005106178)), resulting in the theft of NEST assets from PolyNetwork. The losses incurred include 134,983,260 NEST ERC20 tokens and 9,850,068,599 NEST BEP20 tokens. Furthermore, the consistent sale of stolen NEST tokens by the hackers has led to a continuous decline in the value of NEST since July.

In response to the hacker incident, NESTDAO has made the following attempts:
1. An attempt to negotiate with the hackers for the redemption of the stolen NEST tokens, which unfortunately did not reach an agreement.
2. An attempt to seek compensation from PolyNetwork, but as of now, no compensation plan has been put forth.

Due to the substantial amount of NEST stolen on the BSC chain, and to safeguard the interests of NEST holders on that chain, NESTDAO has endorsed a proposal for the replacement of NEST BEP20 tokens. This replacement was executed on July 11th for NEST tokens on the BSC chain (official statement: [https://twitter.com/NEST_Protocol/status/1678766351295606785](https://twitter.com/NEST_Protocol/status/1678766351295606785)), and the replacement process went smoothly, nullifying the value of NEST BEP20 tokens held by the hackers and minimizing losses within the NEST community on the BSC chain.

Regarding the handling of the stolen NEST ERC20 tokens, considering the rights of NEST users on various exchanges, NESTDAO engaged in extensive discussions and deliberations. Allowing the hackers to continue selling NEST ERC20 tokens would lead to a continuous decrease in NEST's value, thereby eroding the trust NEST team and community have built over the years. To protect the interests of the NEST community and all NEST holders, NESTDAO and the majority of community holders (comprising over 60% of total holdings) mutually agreed to replace the NEST ERC20 token contract. This replacement will enable a 1:1 conversion of the old NEST 1.0 ERC20 tokens into the new NEST 2.0 ERC20 tokens.

The address for the new NEST 2.0 ERC20 tokens is as follows:

- **Token Address: 0xcd6926193308d3B371FdD6A6219067E550000000**
- **Token Symbol: NEST**
- **Token Decimal: 18**

For the process of token replacement, please refer to the user guide on the replacement page: **https://www.nestprotocol.org/nest-replacement**

We kindly ask all community members to actively cooperate in the transition to NEST 2.0 ERC20 tokens. NEST tokens on various exchanges will also be synchronized for replacement. If your NEST tokens are stored on CEX, you are not required to perform any token replacement action.

Please be reminded that you will not be able to exchange for NEST 2.0 ERC20 tokens under the following circumstances:
1. **If your NEST 1.0 ERC20 token address is associated with the hacker's address or you use the exchanges related to the hacker's address after August 17th(UTC+8).**
2. **If you have purchased NEST 1.0 ERC20 tokens on DEX platforms like Uniswap after August 17th(UTC+8).**

Please ensure that you have not engaged in the above-mentioned activities to facilitate a smooth transition to NEST 2.0 ERC20 tokens.

Since its establishment in 2018, NEST Protocol has been dedicated to exploring the decentralized boundaries and constructing a decentralized world. We are constantly iterating our products and building our community. As victims of the PolyNetwork hacker attack incident, we have strived to minimize the losses within the NEST community through our best efforts. As we continue constructing the decentralized trading network for NEST, we are confident in making NEST a leading application within the DeFi industry next year. We also hope that NEST community partners will join us in building and propagating NEST, growing alongside NEST.
